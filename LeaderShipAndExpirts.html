                    <h1>Pilar Reina</h1>
                    <span>Expert on International Weapons and Ammunition Research </span>
                    <p>
                      Pilar Reina is Chief Executive of CCSI UK. She has 12 years of research, policy and field experience across several regions including West <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caucasus and different parts of Asia, including China.  Pilar has worked with governments, practitioners and numerous United Nations agencies and international organisations to address security risks posed by weapons and ammunition stockpiles.
                        Pilar recently led implementation of the African-China-Europe Project on Arms in Africa, successfully advocating for the return of conventional small arms and ammunition control to the agenda of FOCAC (Forum of China and Africa Cooperation) and its inclusion in the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035 agenda.
                        
                        Pilar previously served at the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) as Technical Advisor on small arms and light weapons for West Africa and the Sahel, and worked together with national governments and sub-regional organisations to garner political commitment and coordinated efforts to work on implementing Physical Security and Stockpiles Management best practices on the ground.
                        
                        Prior to that, Pilar worked for the Small Arms Survey where she developed and helped guide a research project on Unplanned Explosions and Munitions Sites. She co-authored the “UEMS: Stockpiles as Liabilities Rather Than Assets” handbook and the UEMS database created through the project continues to serve as an important resource for governments and international organisations. The UEMS indicator helped galvanise international efforts to implement the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines (IATG) as well as efforts by the United Nations Office for Disarmament (UNOD) in creating a group of experts to create a comprehensive framework to prevent accidents at munition sites and munition diversions to unauthorized recipients.
                        
                        Pilar has also worked as an independent consultant with governments and international organisations promoting conventional weapons and ammunition control management. As such, she has provided expert advice in the framework of relevant multilateral, bilateral and regional programs of the United Nations, as an Expert Member of the UN SaferGuard Strategic Coordination Group meeting which reviews the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines annually; and for the European Union, as a contributing member of the Arms Trade Treaty outreach project phase I and II.
                        
                        A native of Colombia, Pilar's upbringing was marked by witnessing the intensity of Colombia's armed conflict of the 1990's. In 1998, aged 17, she was successful in joining the Colombian Air Force as one of the first batch of women cadet officers and future pilot trainees. She went on to study Government and International Relations at the University of Externado, that she completed at Sciences Po, Bordeaux, France. Pilar has a Masters in Public Management (2010) and in Political Science (2013) from the University of Geneva, both with a focus on international security issues. 
                        
                        Pilar is a native Spanish speaker and is fluent in French and English. She also has knowledge of German and Italian.

                <h1>Neil Watts</h1>
                <span>Expert on Sanctions, Maritime Security and Weapons Systems</span>
                <p>
                  Neil Watts advises and consults on the multiple dimensions of Maritime Security – including sanctions compliance and implementation, <span id="dots12">...</span><span id="more12">WMD interdiction, counter-proliferation, vessel-tracking systems and databases, port security, vessel seizure, and counter-piracy.
                   He has conducted extensive training for the maritime industry, state departments and related agencies, and flag state registries, on sanctions and strategic trade control best practices and related effective due diligence. Neil recently began covering aspects of “supply chain resilience” and “sanctions risk mitigation” in particular - which are current concerns in the shipping environment given the prevalent global tensions and resultant sanctions - and inevitable counter sanctions responses by targeted countries and jurisdictions.
                   Formerly a Captain with 33 years’ service in the South African Navy, Neil specialized in surface warfare and weapons systems, serving nearly 20 years at sea onboard a frigate and fast attack missile boats. Neil served as the Maritime Expert on the United Nations Security Council Panel of Experts (POE) for North Korea for five years until July 2018. He investigated sanctions evasion, illicit shipments and networks, tracking suspect vessels worldwide and boarded several North Korean vessels, starting with the Chong Chon Gang in 2013.
                    Neil was also responsible for monitoring North Korea’s navy, which included the Sea Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) program. He co-authored seven reports for the UN Security Council and authored the Maritime Sanctions Handbook for the DPRK. Neil has also contributed to many maritime sanctions articles and news broadcasts concerning North Korea’s illicit activities and sanctions evasion typologies. Prior to joining the Panel, he served on the South African National Maritime Security Advisory Committee, the Priority Committee for Maritime Security, and as a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Counter-piracy Assessment Group. 
                    Until 2013, he was responsible for developing and executing the national counter piracy strategy in the Indian Ocean and maritime operations. Neil holds a master’s degree in International Security and Global Justice from Brooklyn College, and is a graduate of Stellenbosch University (Nautical Science and Political Science), the South African Executive National Security Program (first place and best academic paper) and the Joint Senior Command and Staff Course. He is Senior Research Associate for Kings College London, United Kingdom – Project Alpha, and a member of the Institute for International Security Studies, and the Korea Society.
