                          ,supply chain security, international treaties, UNSC Resolutions, multilateral agreements, and compliance).She has leveraged this expertise while conducting  training and outreach to government officials and corporate leaders  in 70+ countries.
                            She is a Member of Export Controls Expert Group (2008 – present) at the Council for Security and Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP), and of the Working Group on CBRN in Women of Color Advancing Peace and Security (WCAPS). She was also a Co-Chair (2021-22) of Proliferation Finance Workstream, Association of Certified Anti Money-laundering Specialists (ACAMS).
                            Seema’s prior experience includes Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [Lab Lead for International Nonproliferation Export Control Program (INECP)]; the Henry L. Stimson Center [Director, Strategic Trade Management Initiative (STMI), and Senior Fellow, Trade, Technology and Security Program (TTS)]; and  Center for International Trade and Security (CITS) at the University of Georgia [Assistant Director, Training and Outreach].
    
                            Seema has conducted training and outreach for governments and industry around the world, under numerous projects funded by the Departments of State (EXBS, CTR) and Energy (INECP and national labs), United States Institute of Peace, and private foundations (Carnegie Corporation, Ford Foundation, Smith Richardson, Rockefeller Fund, and Japan Center for Global Partnership). 
    
                            Her training and organizational experience has included over 25 sessions of the Security and Strategic Trade Management Academy (SSTMA) between 2007 and 2021, funded by EXBS and designed for foreign government officials who are tasked with establishing national strategic trade management systems and complying with UNSCR 1540. In April 2021, she organized the first ever virtual SSTMA. More than 2000 officials from 70+ countries, including numerous EXBS advisors, have gone through the SSTMA trainings, and provided near-unanimous positive evaluations about the quality of content. Seema has also designed and conducted customized training to government officials and industry from China, the Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, UAE and Vietnam on STC, CBRN security and international sanctions.
    
                            In addition, Seema helped draft a 1540-relevant STC law for CARICOM countries, to utilize as a base for their individual legal adaptations. She has recently concluded a survey of 1540 Points of Contact and a series of interactions with Indian bio-scientists and industry, exploring post-COVID bio-security challenges and opportunities. She has participated in numerous discussions on the importance of government-industry and government-academia partnerships in regulating dual-use materials and technologies, especially with reference to intangible technology transfers.
    
                            Her current research focus is on the feasibility of multilateral standards on implementing sanctions and related issues of technology transfers and supply chain security. She is exploring how e-tools and blockchain technology can be harnessed to strengthen national and regional responses to STC and sanctions compliance in this regard.

                      <span>Expert on International Weapons and Ammunition Research</span>
                      <p class="about">
                        Pilar is an International Weapons and Ammunition Research Expert with over twelve years of experience in this field.
                      </p>
                        <p class="additional-content" style="display: none;">
                          She has research, policy and field experience across several regions including West Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caucasus and different parts of Asia, including China. Pilar has worked with governments, practitioners and numerous United Nations agencies and international organisations to address security risks posed by weapons and ammunition stockpiles.
    
                          Pilar recently led implementation of the African-China-Europe Project on Arms in Africa, successfully advocating for the return of conventional small arms and ammunition control to the agenda of FOCAC (Forum of China and Africa Cooperation) and its inclusion in the China-Africa Cooperation Vision 2035 agenda.
                          
                          Pilar previously served at the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) as Technical Advisor on small arms and light weapons for West Africa and the Sahel, and worked together with national governments and sub-regional organisations to garner political commitment and coordinated efforts to work on implementing Physical Security and Stockpiles Management best practices on the ground.
                          
                          Prior to that, Pilar worked for the Small Arms Survey where she developed and helped guide a research project on Unplanned Explosions and Munitions Sites. She co-authored the “UEMS: Stockpiles as Liabilities Rather Than Assets” handbook and the UEMS database created through the project continues to serve as an important resource for governments and international organisations. The UEMS indicator helped galvanise international efforts to implement the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines (IATG) as well as efforts by the United Nations Office for Disarmament (UNOD) in creating a group of experts to create a comprehensive framework to prevent accidents at munition sites and munition diversions to unauthorized recipients.
                          
                          Pilar has also worked as an independent consultant with governments and international organisations promoting conventional weapons and ammunition control management. As such, she has provided expert advice in the framework of relevant multilateral, bilateral and regional programs of the United Nations, as an Expert Member of the UN SaferGuard Strategic Coordination Group meeting which reviews the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines annually; and for the European Union, as a contributing member of the Arms Trade Treaty outreach project phase I and II.
                          
                          A native of Colombia, Pilar's upbringing was marked by witnessing the intensity of Colombia's armed conflict of the 1990's. In 1998, aged 17, she was successful in joining the Colombian Air Force as one of the first batch of women cadet officers and future pilot trainees. She went on to study Government and International Relations at the University of Externado, that she completed at Sciences Po, Bordeaux, France. Pilar has a Masters in Public Management (2010) and in Political Science (2013) from the University of Geneva, both with a focus on international security issues. 
                          
                          Pilar is a native Spanish speaker and is fluent in French and English. She also has knowledge of German and Italian.
